TODO: ADD A SUMMARY HERE
## Social Media Posts

**Use capital letters in hashtags:** Punctuation helps text-to-speech tools like screen readers speak more accurately, and helps with readability overall. This includes in hashtags where capital letters help distinguish words.

> Make it a habit to #UseCapitalLetters rather than #hardtoreadlowercase

**Don‚Äôt share just images of text:** Images of text (such as your favorite quote or saying) can be difficult for people with visual impairments to read and don‚Äôt allow people with reading difficulties to leverage text-to-speech read-aloud features. When posting these kinds of images, also write out the text in your post.

<figure role="figure" aria-label="Typing out the text in an image makes the content more accessible.">
	<img alt="Instagram post where the photo is a quote reading 'Whatever is good for your soul do that - Anurup' and the quote's text is also typed in the post." src="/img/posts/2021-06-14-Everyday_Accessibility/instagram_quote.jpg" />

**Use ‚Äúalt text‚Äù features to describe images:** Pictures are significant in social media, but also inaccessible to visually impaired readers unless they have a text-based description. When uploading, find the ‚Äúimage description‚Äù or ‚Äúalternative/alt text‚Äù feature in the software to write a description. Don‚Äôt write every detail, just enough to ensure everyone can understand your post and share in the image‚Äôs meaning. For more, read Scott Vinkle‚Äôs [Considerations when writing alt text](https://ux.shopify.com/considerations-when-writing-alt-text-a9c1985a8204).

**Limit your emojis:** Emojis are great for emphasis and playfulness, but too many and in unconventional placements can be distracting and hard to read. Keep your emojis to the minimum needed to make your point, group them together, and move them towards the end of any text.

> **When you write:** I üëè know üëè that‚Äôs üëè right üëè!!!
> **Text-to-speech reads:** I \[_clapping hands_\] know \[_clapping hands_\] that‚Äôs \[_clapping hands_\] right \[_clapping hands_\] !!!

## Documents

**Use a program‚Äôs built-in styling features:** Assistive technology (AT) doesn‚Äôt interpret a page or document like people do with their eyes, it reads the underlying code markup. This means simply making something _look_ a certain way falls apart when using AT. When formatting a document or presentation, use the style buttons/options in the program to provide the needed markup; for instance, use the ‚Äúbulleted list‚Äù button rather than just a dash (-) to format a list.

<figure role="figure" aria-label="Explicitly select format options like Numbered List in Microsoft Word to increase accessibility.">
	<img alt="Sample document with title and numbered list with arrows pointing out the numbered list option in the menus and the Heading 1 style of text used for the title." src="/img/posts/2021-06-14-Everyday_Accessibility/WordRibbon.png" />

**Include document structure:** Headings (or titles on slides) provide a great way for everyone to preview, skim, and search content. Structure is particularly helpful for blind readers who want to get an overview of the document before reading line-by-line. Include headings throughout a document and titles on every slide, and remember to use the actual ‚ÄúHeading‚Äù and ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù features of the program, not simply stylized text.

<figure role="figure" aria-label="Using PowerPoint's built-in title placeholders is important for accessibility.">
	<img alt="Two plain slides each have titles. The mouse cursor hovers over the second slide's thumbnail to show the title appears as mouse hover content when properly formatted." src="/img/posts/2021-06-14-Everyday_Accessibility/PPT_Titles.png" />
	<figcaption>Using PowerPoint's built-in "title" placeholders is important for accessibility.</figcaption>

**Add alt text to images:** Just like with social media, you can add alt text descriptions to images in documents as well. You will typically see an input box to add descriptions grouped with other options when you insert the image.

<figure role="figure" aria-label="Add image descriptions (alt text) to images in documents, as in Microsoft Word's Alt Text option.">
	<img alt="Word document has photo inserted and selected. In the right pane, the Alt Text option is open and showing an input field that reads 'White and yellow flowers'." src="/img/posts/2021-06-14-Everyday_Accessibility/Windows-AltText.png" />

**Use accessibility checkers:** Microsoft products (namely Word and PowerPoint) come with a ‚ÄúCheck Accessibility‚Äù option. Use this to double-check you‚Äôve addressed key accessibility needs.

<figure role="figure" aria-label="Microsoft's Check Accessibility feature helps ensure your document is inclusive.">
	<img alt="The Check Accessibility menu option is activated on a small PowerPoint deck. The Accessibility pane shows the 'Missing slide title' error. The mouse hover text for that slide also reads '[No Title]'." src="/img/posts/2021-06-14-Everyday_Accessibility/PPT_A11yChecker.png" />

## Audio and Video Content
1. **Have clear audio:**Though all of our devices can record audio and video on-demand, sound quality can vary.  Be sure to speak as clearly as possible, preferably at a steady pace and reasonable volume, and remove or avoid background noise including echo, empty room effect, humming, or white noise.
> Using a microphone (even a common corded headset) usually helps amplify voices and minimize distracting unwanted sounds.
2. **Reduce background music:** Instrumental music can enhance content‚Äôs quality, but not when it reduces the ability to hear the main speaker. When using background music, keep it to a minimum (such as during an intro) or, if used throughout, ensure it is very low.
> Consider putting your background music at the volume of a whisper.
3. **Provide text with the multimedia:** As with images, video and audio can be engaging but also inaccessible without a text equivalent for people who are deaf-blind, having sensory processing disorders, or have hearing impairments. Having media content written out as text is vital for inclusiveness. Text equivalents can include transcripts that type out spoken dialogue, or an article that accompanies a video (as in a video that supplements a news article).
> Where there‚Äôs media, make sure there‚Äôs also text.
4. **Ensure you have no flashing content:** Content that flashes on the screen more than 3 times per second is dangerous as it can trigger a seizure in some viewers. Ensure any rapidly moving content is below this threshold.
> The Trace Center‚Äôs [Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool (PEAT)](https://trace.umd.edu/peat/) is a free, downloadable resource for developers to identify seizure risks in their web content and software.
## Advocate for Accessibility
1. **Seek accessibility features:** Actively search for ‚Äúaccessibility‚Äù in the software you use every day ‚Äî from survey creation tools to website design platforms. Understand what you can do to make sure your output is inclusive.
<!-- <figure role="figure" aria-label="Search for accessibility tips in your favorite systems like this Typeform How To article.">
	<img alt="Help Center page from Typeform, an online survey creation service, regarding how to make accessible typeforms." src="/img/posts/2021-06-14-Everyday_Accessibility/Accessible_Typeforms.png" />
	<figcaption>Search for accessibility tips in your favorite systems like this Typeform "How To" article.</figcaption>
</figure> -->
2. **Ask about accessibility:** If a system doesn‚Äôt offer accessibility features (which is unfortunately very common), reach out to the company to ask about it via the company‚Äôs customer support channels. Also ask about it internally where you work and attend school. Don‚Äôt leave this to just your disabled colleagues to take on.
> Customer pressure can help move accessibility to the front of a company‚Äôs roadmap.
3. **Seek to learn more:** There‚Äôs a lot more to learn and the more allies who know about accessible and inclusive digital practices, the more we can make a big difference for who can participate in our ever-growing digital spaces.
